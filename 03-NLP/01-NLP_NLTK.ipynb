    "\n",
    "Why would we use natural language processing? How does it relate to other things we might be doing -- or trying to do -- with text in our research?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing is a field of computer science and linguistics; it aims to enable computers to process and derive meaning from input in human language. NLP research is being used to automate tasks like translation, question answering, voice recognition, and language generation."

    "### Task: Document Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We're often interested in characterizing text from different sources, e.g. measuring the ideology of different politicians based on the language used in their speeches. A simple case would be a situation in which we have a bunch of documents that we want to label as \"positive\" or \"negative\". This is often called \"sentiment analysis\", and it can be very difficult, despite only having two categories, because sentiment is a subjective and often subtle idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sentiment analysis involves human judgment about the meaning of language, we'll need to do this in a supervised manner, using training data that has already been labeled. We'll need to use a bit of machine learning for this task, but we'll use one of the existing classifiers provided by `scikit-learn`. These classifiers take a set of training documents that have already been categorized, and learn how to predict the categories of other documents. We'll use the NLTK Movie Reviews corpus for our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't give a classifier raw text, because it wouldn't know how to use human language in its calculations. Instead, we represent each document by a vector of features (numeric or boolean values) and then the machine learns what combinations of those features fall into each category. Throughout the workshop today, we'll learn how NLP tools can help us extract different features from documents, to represent the documents with more meaningful or relevant information that might help classify them more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first import `nltk` and download some of the tools we'll use."

If you have your documents in different files, however, NLTK provides a class called PlainTextCorpusReader for working with a corpus as a group of text files.

For instance, in the sentence \"The black cat climbed over the tall fence\", we might want to treat \"The black cat\" as one thing (the subject), \"climbed over\" as a distinct act, and \"the tall fence\" as another thing (the object). The first and third sequences are noun phrases, and the second is a verb phrase.\n",

    "We can separate these phrases by \"chunking\" the sentence, i.e. splitting it into larger chunks than individual tokens. This is also an important step toward identifying entities, which are often represented by more than one word. You can probably imagine certain patterns that would define a noun phrase, using part of speech tags. For instance, a determiner (e.g. an article like \"the\") could be concatenated onto the noun that follows it. If there's an adjective between them, we can include that too.\n",

    "To define rules about how to structure words based on their part of speech tags, we use a grammar (in this case, a \"chunk grammar\"). NLTK provides a RegexpParser that takes as input a grammar composed of regular expressions. The grammar is defined as a string, with one line for each rule we define. Each rule starts with the label we want to assign to the chunk (e.g. NP for \"noun phrase\"), followed by a colon, then an expression in regex-like notation that will be matched to tokens' POS tags.\n",
